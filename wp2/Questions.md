DONE 1. `marker_repo.py` `def guided_search`
   
**search_terms**: what term can we search for, when we use this function. 
- guided_search: same function performed in two different types of information --> output depennds on whether we choose metadata or marker_list


DONE 2. `scoring.py` `compare_marker_lists`

**score**: the meaning of the score
- 0 means the most specific within this selection
- 1 indicates that the marker is the most prevalent
Our assumption: neither is good nor bad it just depends on what we're looking for in the data.

**wrapper function**: create the two-column format for the marker list

**mr.export_marker_list**: this function displays an error when we try to run it: Attribute error
